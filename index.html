            <h2>Game Tutorial</h2>
            <p>The goal of <strong>Lights Out</strong> is to turn ON all the lights on the grid.</p>
            <p>Clicking a light toggles its state and the state of its immediate neighbors.</p>
            <p>If all lights are turned ON, you win!</p>
            <p>Remember: A blue cell means the light is OFF, and a white cell means the light is ON.</p>

            <h3>Addendum</h3>
            <p>This game was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary challenge was ensuring the board's starting configuration was solvable while maintaining randomness. The solution involved simulating random clicks on an initially empty board. The grid and styles were designed for clarity and user engagement. This project enhanced my skills in dynamic styling and event handling with JavaScript.</p>
